  abstract = {This paper proposes an extension of generalized linear models to the analysis of longitudinal data. We introduce a class of estimating equations that give consistent estimates of the regression parameters and of their variance under mild assumptions about the time dependence. The estimating equations are derived without specifying the joint distribution of a subject's observations yet they reduce to the score equations for niultivariate Gaussian outcomes. Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the pioposecl estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood. {\textcopyright} 1986 Biometrika Trust.},

@article{Mancl2001,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose an alternative covariance estimator to the robust covariance estimator of generalized estimating equations (GEE). Hypothesis tests using the robust covariance estimator can have inflated size when the number of independent clusters is small. Resampling methods, such as the jackknife and bootstrap, have been suggested for covariance estimation when the number of clusters is small. A drawback of the resampling methods when the response is binary is that the methods can break down when the number of subjects is small due to zero or near-zero cell counts caused by resampling. We propose a bias-corrected covariance estimator that avoids this problem. In a small simulation study, we compare the bias-corrected covariance estimator to the robust and jackknife covariance estimators for binary responses for situations involving 10-40 subjects with equal and unequal cluster sizes of 16-64 observations. The bias-corrected covariance estimator gave tests with sizes close to the nominal level even when the number of subjects was 10 and cluster sizes were unequal whereas the robust and jackknife covariance estimators gave tests with sizes that could be 2-3 times the nominal level. The methods are illustrated using data from a randomized clinical trial on treatment for bone loss in subjects with periodontal disease.},

@article{Wang2011,
abstract = {Generalized estimating equations (GEE (Biometrika 1986; 73(1):13-22) is a general statistical method to fit marginal models for correlated or clustered responses, and it uses a robust sandwich estimator to estimate the variance-covariance matrix of the regression coefficient estimates. While this sandwich estimator is robust to the misspecification of the correlation structure of the responses, its finite sample performance deteriorates as the number of clusters or observations per cluster decreases. To address this limitation, Pan (Biometrika 2001; 88(3):901-906) and Mancl and DeRouen (Biometrics 2001; 57(1):126-134) investigated two modifications to the original sandwich variance estimator. Motivated by the ideas underlying these two modifications, we propose a novel robust variance estimator that combines the strengths of these estimators. Our theoretical and numerical results show that the proposed estimator attains better efficiency and achieves better finite sample performance compared with existing estimators. In particular, when the sample size or cluster size is small, our proposed estimator exhibits lower bias and the resulting confidence intervals for GEE estimates achieve better coverage rates performance. We illustrate the proposed method using data from a dental study. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd..},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {Background: Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology enable researchers to collect a large volume of metagenomic sequencing data. These data provide valuable resources for investigating interactions between the microbiome and host environmental/clinical factors. In addition to the well-known properties of microbiome count measurements, for example, varied total sequence reads across samples, over-dispersion and zero-inflation, microbiome studies usually collect samples with hierarchical structures, which introduce correlation among the samples and thus further complicate the analysis and interpretation of microbiome count data. Results: In this article, we propose negative binomial mixed models (NBMMs) for detecting the association between the microbiome and host environmental/clinical factors for correlated microbiome count data. Although having not dealt with zero-inflation, the proposed mixed-effects models account for correlation among the samples by incorporating random effects into the commonly used fixed-effects negative binomial model, and can efficiently handle over-dispersion and varying total reads. We have developed a flexible and efficient IWLS (Iterative Weighted Least Squares) algorithm to fit the proposed NBMMs by taking advantage of the standard procedure for fitting the linear mixed models. Conclusions: We evaluate and demonstrate the proposed method via extensive simulation studies and the application to mouse gut microbiome data. The results show that the proposed method has desirable properties and outperform the previously used methods in terms of both empirical power and Type I error. The method has been incorporated into the freely available R package BhGLM (http://www.ssg.uab.edu/bhglm/and http://github.com/abbyyan3/BhGLM), providing a useful tool for analyzing microbiome data.},

abstract = {Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) is now well established as a method for estimating the parameters of the general Gaussian linear model with a structured covariance matrix, in particular for mixed linear models. Conventionally, estimates of precision and inference for fixed effects are based on their asymptotic distribution, which is known to be inadequate for some small-sample problems. In this paper, we present a scaled Wald statistic, together with an F approximation to its sampling distribution, that is shown to perform well in a range of small sample settings. The statistic uses an adjusted estimator of the covariance matrix that has reduced small sample bias. This approach has the advantage that it reproduces both the statistics and F distributions in those settings where the latter is exact, namely for Hotelling T2 type statistics and for analysis of variance F-ratios. The performance of the modified statistics is assessed through simulation studies of four different REML analyses and the methods are illustrated using three examples.},

@article{Tsonaka2021,
abstract = {Time-course RNAseq experiments, where tissues are repeatedly collected from the same subjects, e.g. humans or animals over time or under several different experimental conditions, are becoming more popular due to the reducing sequencing costs. Such designs offer the great potential to identify genes that change over time or progress differently in time across experimental groups. Modelling of the longitudinal gene expression in such time-course RNAseq data is complicated by the serial correlations, missing values due to subject dropout or sequencing errors, long follow up with potentially non-linear progression in time and low number of subjects. Negative Binomial mixed models can address all these issues. However, such models under the maximum likelihood (ML) approach are less popular for RNAseq data due to convergence issues (see, e.g. [1]). We argue in this paper that it is the use of an inaccurate numerical integration method in combination with the typically small sample sizes which causes such mixed models to fail for a great portion of tested genes. We show that when we use the accurate adaptive Gaussian quadrature approach to approximate the integrals over the random-effects terms, we can successfully estimate the model parameters with the maximum likelihood method. Moreover, we show that the boostrap method can be used to preserve the type I error rate in small sample settings. We evaluate empirically the small sample properties of the test statistics and compare with state-of-the-art approaches. The method is applied on a longitudinal mice experiment to study the dynamics in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.
